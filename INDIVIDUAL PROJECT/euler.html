		<h1> Project Euler </h1>
		<p><a href="https://www.projecteuler.net"> Project Euler </a> is a website dedicated to challenging users to create code-based solutions to complex math problems. My best friend Jared and I challenge each other to write Python code to solve these problems, and optimize our code to run as fast as possible. The problems are designed to be able to be solved by average computer hardware in under a minute. In the past three months, I have completed eight problems in my spare time, and plan to complete many more in the future. An example is stated as below:

		<p> I upload all of my solutions to my <a href="https://github.com/cedson61/project-euler">github page,</a> and each of my solutions runs successfully in under a minute.
