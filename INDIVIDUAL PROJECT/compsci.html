		<p>I have always been interested in computers, how they work, and how to give them instructions. I have been independently studying computer science, penetration testing, and computer security for close to five years, and I have made many achievements! So far, I have: </p> <br> <br>
		<ul> made over 200 contributions on github </ul>
		<ul> completed the university of helsinki's computer science course with a 96% </ul>
		<ul> designed a wireless pentesting "rifle" that can penetrate wireless networks from over a mile away (radio focusing) </ul>
		<ul> moderated the development of <a href="https://github.com/guardicore/monkey" target="blank">monkey</a>, a covert penetration testing tool under an online internship from guardicore</ul>
